Yep, looks like it still isn't handled automatically!

You have to do do some little tweaks for it to work.

First, **open Firefox** and in the navigation bar, **write about:config**
![](/content/images/2020/04/image.png)It will open this page
Then, search for **dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled** and change the value of it to **1**.

Now, close Firefox and **open /etc/security/pam_env.conf ** with your favorite code editor. You will have to use a **sudo** here as it is normally protected.

At the bottom of the file , Â paste this code: 

`MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 DEFAULT=1`

Now, reboot your computer and you should be good to go ! :)
